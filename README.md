# BitjockeySoundboard
A user-interactive web application that facilitates submission of sound files to a public soundboard in KANM's bitjockey software

This project offered a solution to KANM's (a Texas A&M Student Internet Radio Organization) current soundboard setup. Before our version, members would use Youtube to play sound clips on their shows. The problem that the organization ran into, however, was that some students were able to play explicit/innapropriate sounds, the org had no way of moderating what was played through Youtube. 

To solve this, we decided to make an application that first allowed members to submit the sound clips they wanted to use on their show to a database. Then, once submitted, the KANM admin team would be able to go through all requests, listen to each clip, and either approve or deny the sound. If approved, the sound would then be placed into the public soundboard, available to all members through a module in Bitjockey, the organization's house-built radio streaming software. The soundboard contains buttons for each sound and (will have soon) a favoriting system where individual users can have different sounds at the top of their own soundboard.
